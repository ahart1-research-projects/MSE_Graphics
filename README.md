# MSE_Graphics
This repository contains scripts that produce summary graphics for an Atlantic herring Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). Scripts contained herein reflect the multi-step process of developing summary graphics in R but do not reflect the full range of discussions that lead to final graphic products which the New England Fisheries Management Council (NEFMC) used to disseminate MSE results.
